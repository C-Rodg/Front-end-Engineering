## Common Considerations

- Time complexity (Big O) - important?
- Space complexity - important?
- What is the expected size of this?
- Can I destroy the data structure - in-place (save space) vs. out-of-place (no side effects)?
- Can there be negative numbers?
- Can there be duplicates?
- Is the list already sorted?

## Runtimes & Space Complexity - Big O Notation

- Constant Time O(1): no matter how many elements, will always take the same time.
- Logarithmic Time O(log n): occurs when doubling number of elements doesn't double the amount of work. Most searches of sorted data are logarithmic.
- Linear Time O(n): iterating through all elements. 1 more element = 1 more unit of work.
- Quasilinear Time O(n \* log n): divide and conquer, but must iterate through n. Most sorts are quasilinear.
- Quadratic Time O(n^2): every element has to be compared to every other element
- Exponential Time O(2^n): for every one more element, processing power required doubles.

**Space Complexity** measures the amount of space needed to perform. Most primitives (numbers, bools, etc.) are O(1). Strings, arrays, and objects are O(n.length) because a string that is length of n, will take up twice as much memory for a string length of 2n.

**Logarithms**: log2^value = exponent || 2^exponent = value. How many times you can divide a number by 2 before it reaches 1.

## Useful Formulas

- **Compact Array Formula:** (typically used with binary heaps)

  - "i"'s parent = Math.floor((i-1) / 2)
  - "i"'s left child = 2i + 1
  - "i"'s right child = 2i + 2

- **Normalize Array Shifts:** (useful for array rotations)

  - (current index + amount shifted left or right (+/-)) % array.length = new index
  - if new index is less than 0, then add array.length

- **Max Sub Array:** (Kandane's Algorithm)

  - set current, global = arr[0]
  - loop: for 1...arr.length - 1
  - current = Math.max(arr[i], current + arr[i])
  - current > global ? then global = current

- **Triangular Series:**

  - a series of numbers where each number could be a row in an equilateral triangle (starts with 1 and increases by 1)
  - Example: 1,2,3,4,5; Sum = 15
  - Pairs of numbers on each side will always add up to the same value which will be 'n' + 1. i.e. 1 + 5 = 6, 2+ 4 = 6, 3 + 3 = 6
  - The formula for this would be:
    - (n^2 + n) / 2 = Sum of integers to 'n'
  - This formula can be re-written as: (n^2 + n) = 2 \* Sum, which is quadratic
    -Quadratic formula format: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    -Quadratic formula: ( -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ) / 2a

- **Sum Formula:**

  - useful for finding the missing number in a series of 1 to n
  - Sum of 1 to 'n' === (n \* (n+1)) / 2

- **Euclidean/Manhattan Distance Formula:**
  - useful for finding the distance between two points
  - allows for diagonal distance. If not needed use the 'Manhattan Distance' instead
  - Euclidean Distance 'd' = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 )
  - Manhattan Distance 'd' = abs(x2-x1) + abs(y2-y1)

## Problem Solving Patterns

- **Frequency Counters:**

  - build 1 map, then subtract (or build 2)
  - Examples: strings, anagrams...
  - `{ a: 2, c: 1: t: 2}`

- **Multiple Pointers:**

  - uses two pointers (usually a read and a write pointer) and moves them in direction toward solution
  - Examples: Pairs of sorted integers, unique values

- **Sliding Window:**

  - create a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
  - Examples: Find max sum of 'n' adjacent indexes (Kandane's Algorithm), find longest set of unique characters

- **Divide & Conquer:**

  - Consistently divide solution down to 1 (logarithm)
  - Examples: Merge sort, quick sort, binary search

- **Dynamic Programming:**

  - used when a naive approach will result in exponential (2^n) runtime
  - problem to be solved must have an _optimal substructure_ and _overlapping subproblems_
  - uses pre-computed values for solved sub-problems so that we don't have to solve them again
  - Examples: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Levenshtein/Edit Distance

## The Interview

1. Clarify the problem

   - Ask for an example
   - State assumptions
   - Ask questions (use common consideration list above)

1. Design a solution

   - Iterate on solutions
   - Discuss tradeoffs with time & space complexity

1. Write code
1. Review

   - Always **TEST** your code! Test normal cases first, and edge cases later.

## System Design Interviews

- **Process:**
  - Break it down
    - Always clarify! _What are features? Sort by time? Store all content? What platform? Work offline?.._
  - Analyze tradeoffs
  - Navigate levels of abstraction

A type of system design interview might be something like 'how would you build an rss reader?'. These types of interviews are more about diagrams and pseudocode than real code.

## Notes

- Call stack can handle ~10,000 frames before stack overflow
