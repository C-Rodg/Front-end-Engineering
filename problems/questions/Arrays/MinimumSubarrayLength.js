// Given an array of positive integers and an integer 'k', find the minimal
// length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is equal to k.
// If there isn't one return 0.

// Input: arr = [2,3,1,2,4,3], k = 7
// Output: 2 because the subarray [4,3] is the minimum

// Hint 1: Sliding window

// Hint 2: Think about when to expand and when to shrink.
