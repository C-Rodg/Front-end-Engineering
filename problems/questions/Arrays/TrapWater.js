// Given an array of non-negative integers
// representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
// compute how much water is able to be trapped after raining.

// Input: [1,0,0,2,0,0,3]
// Output: 6 because 2 blocks between 1 & 2, and 4 blocks between 2 & 3

function trapWater(arr) {
	return Number;
}

// Hint 1: Compute columns in two passes
