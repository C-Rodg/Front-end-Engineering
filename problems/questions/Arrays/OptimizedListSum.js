// Given an array of numbers, create a function that returns a range from x (inclusive) to y (exclusive).
// You should use a data structure to optimize.

// Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] to create.  Then (2, 5) to call.
// Output: 12 because 3 + 4 + 5 = 12

// Hint 1: Would an additional array help?

// Hint 2: Break it down into initializing vs. calling
