// Find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges.
// A minimum spanning tree touches all nodes at the lowest cost.

// Vertex: (node, weight)
//  1: (2, 1), (3, 1)
//  2: (1, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)
//  3: (1, 1), (2, 2), (5, 3)
//  4: (2, 3), (5, 2)
//  5: (3, 3), (4, 2)

// Minimum Spanning Tree would be:
// 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 = cost of 7
