// A robot is located at the top-left corner of an m x n grid.
// The robot can only move down or right at any point in time.
// He is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
// How many unique paths are there?

// Input:
// m = 3, n = 2
// Output:
// 3
// 3 total ways: Right > Right > Down; Right > Down > Right; Down > Right > Right

// Input:
// m = 7, n = 3
// Output: 28

// Hint 1:
// How many ways to get to do it in a 4x4 grid? Or a 2x2? Or..?

// Hint 2:
// One way to get to start position.
