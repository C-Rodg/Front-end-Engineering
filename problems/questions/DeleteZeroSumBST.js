// Difficulty: Easy
// Topic: Postorder DFS, BST, recursion

// Given root of a binary tree delete
// any subtrees whose nodes sum up to zero.

// Runtime: O(n)
// Space: O(h) - because recursive solution will
// take up the space of the height of the tree.  It
// will be O(log n) for balanced and O(n) in worst case
