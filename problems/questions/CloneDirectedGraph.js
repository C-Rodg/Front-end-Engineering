// Difficulty: Medium
// Topic: Graph traversal, Cloning

// Given root node of a directed graph,
// clone this graph by creating its deep copy
// such that cloned graph has same vertices and
// edges as the original graph.

// Runtime: O(n)
// Memory: O(n) - n is number of vertices in graph (worst case)
