// Given a number n, determine what the longest consecutive bit '1's this number has in binary.

// Input: 242
// Output: 4 because 242 in binary is 11110010, which has 4 consecutive 1's

// Hint 1: Bit Manipulation

// Hint 2: How would you determine if there is a 1 in the right most bit?

// Hint 3: Right shifts til zero...
